These tests validate this implementation using the relevant
[official test vectors](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Random-Number-Generators).
I have modified the format (without changing the vectors) to make it easier to validate using the implemented function.
