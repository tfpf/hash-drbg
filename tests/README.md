These tests validate this implementation using the relevant
[official test vectors](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Algorithm-Validation-Program/Random-Number-Generators).
I have modified the format (without changing the vectors) so that the test input may be read in the same way entropy
input is read.
