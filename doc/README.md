# Technical Information
| Property               | Value    |
| :--------------------: | :------: |
| Security Strength      | 256 bits |
| Hash                   | SHA-256  |
| Prediction Resistance  | Yes      |
| Additional Input       | No       |
| Personalisation String | No       |

* SHA-256 has been implemented from scratch, because I wanted this package to have no dependencies.
* It is assumed that `/dev/urandom` always provides sufficient entropy for seeding.

# Functions
```C
struct hdrbg_t *hdrbg_new(void);
```
Create and initialise (seed) an HDRBG object.
* → Dynamically allocated HDRBG object. To prevent memory leaks, it must be deallocated using `hdrbg_delete`.

---

```C
void hdrbg_renew(struct hdrbg_t *hd);
```
Reinitialise (reseed) an HDRBG object.
* `hd` HDRBG object. It must have been created by calling `hdrbg_new`.

---

```C
bool hdrbg_gen(struct hdrbg_t *hd, bool prediction_resistance, uint8_t *r_bytes, size_t r_length);
```
Generate cryptographically secure pseudorandom bytes.
* `hd` HDRBG object. It must have been created by calling `hdrbg_new`.
* `prediction_resistance` Whether prediction resistance is desired (i.e. whether `hd` should be reinitialised before
  generating the bytes). This makes the next state of `hd` unpredictable even if its current state were to somehow
  become known.
* `r_bytes` Array to store the generated bytes in. (It must have sufficient space for `r_length` elements.)
* `r_length` Number of bytes to generate. At most 65536.
* → `true` if `r_length` is less than or equal to 65536, else `false`. In the latter case, the contents of `r_bytes`
  are not changed.

---

```C
void hdrbg_delete(struct hdrbg_t *hd);
```
Clear (zero) and destroy an HDRBG object.
* `hd` HDRBG object. It must have been created by calling `hdrbg_new`.
